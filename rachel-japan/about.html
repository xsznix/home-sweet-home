				<h1>Hi! I'm Rachel.</h1>
				<p>This summer I will be going to Tohoku, Japan along with 6 other people from Austin Chinese Church with <a href="http://jems.org/" target="_blank">Japanese Evangelical Missionary Society</a> (JEMS). Tohoku is in northern Japan and was heavily impacted by the March 11 tsunami in 2011. It has been two years and the people there still desperately need physical, emotional, and most importantly, spiritual help. My team is going to Minamisanriku, where we will be partnering with SOLA and helping with children’s ministry. This will be my first missions trip and I am beyond excited to see what God has in store for me and the people of Japan!</p>
				
				<h2>Please consider supporting me to make this trip possible.</h2>
				
				<h3>Pray for me.</h3>
				<p class="it">Pray that God will provide friendships with key people and open their hearts to the gospel message. Pray for boldness and courage as I live out Christ’s love in faith.</p>
				<h3>Buy some crafts.</h3>
				<p class="it">To help fundraise for ths trip, my friends and I are selling an assortment of homemade crafts. All proceeds will go towards funding this trip.</p>
				<h3>Donate to JEMS.</h3>
				<p class="it">If nothing on this site interests you, you can still help by giving online on the <a href="https://secure-q.net/donations/JEMS/632" target="_blank">JEMS online donation page</a>. Under Categories and Funds, select “Japan Short-term Missions,” and then “Austin Chinese Church Japan Summer Missions 2013” in the box that appears.</p>
				 
				<p>My goal is to raise $2,900 by July 15th to cover the cost of the trip. You can peruse this wonderfully designed website and email me what you would like order. The prices next to each item are suggestions; please donate however much or little you would like. I will arrange for you to receive the item(s) you ordered in a timely manner.</p>
				
				<p>Thank you so much for visiting this site and thank you in advance for your support in any form. I trust that God will provide for everything and his glory will be made known to the nations.</p>
				
				<p>Love,<br>Rachel</p>
